              As unpredictable and varied as any the peoples on Golarion, humans have the exceptional
              drive and capacity to endure and expand. Though many civilizations thrived before
              humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most
              terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous
              people in the realms around the Inner Sea.
