              You have a knack for learning, and from a young age, you
              sequestered yourself from the outside world to learn all that you
              could. You’ve read about so many wondrous places and things in
              your books, and you’ve always dreamed about one day seeing the
              real things. Eventually, that curiosity led you to leave your
              studies and become an adventurer.
