              As unpredictable and varied as any the peoples on Golarion, humans
              have the exceptional drive and capacity to endure and expand.
              Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to
              prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most
              terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today
              they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner
              Sea.
